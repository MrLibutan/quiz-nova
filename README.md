# üß† Quiz Nova

**Quiz Nova** is a dynamic quiz app built with **React fundamentals** ‚Äî including components, props, state, and effects.

Users can configure their own quiz by selecting the **number of questions**, **category**, and **difficulty**, and the app will fetch randomized questions from the **[Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/)**.

This project was built during my early React learning phase ‚Äî before I explored tools like Context or Redux. As a result, you may notice some prop drilling in the code, which I plan to refactor in the future.
